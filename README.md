# Virtual SAP Cloud Platform Technical Academy
Over the course 5 weeks, particpants will be implementing a Safety Incident Application based on an an event driven architecture. The core compoents of this architcture will be:
1. SAP CLoud Platform Application Programming Model or CAP for short (based on Node JS)
2. Enterprise Messaging and FAAS (Functions as a Service)
3. Workflow
4. User Interfaces (UI5, Mobile Development Kit and Conversational AI)
5. SAC - SAP Analytics Cloud

## High level architecture for our scenario is the following:

In this business scenario, as part of an ongoing focus on safety in the workplace, we would like to provide our employees with a way to report potential safety incidents. 
From an IT perspective, we would like to create a custom application based on micro services that will allow us to deliver the application in a flexible, cloud native manner. As part of the implementation, users will be provided with a choice of interfaces to create a service incident (Native Mobile, Mobile Web or Conversational AI). These user interfaces will take advantage of standardized rest/odata services that are generated by the SAP Cloud Platform Application Programming Model (AKA CAP).
In addition, we would like to take advantage of enterprise messaging so that we can publish an event each time an incident is reported so that we can loosely couple other applications that might be interested in such an event. Given that we will have incident messages available to us, we will use this architecture to instantiate a workflow for each incident that is created so that we may review the content of the message prior to approving it.
